 An attempt to mimic Terraria's Magic Mirror, with a touch of Minecraft!

This Mod adds Magic Mirrors to the game that can teleport you to your bed location! It is inspired by Magic Mirror item from Terraria.
Mirrors aren't capable to teleport you across dimensions before an upgrade. To upgrade the mirror, you need to find Dimension Crystal to turn them into Dimensional Mirrors!
